********
This is a script for training an LSTM-based model on a transcription dataset. The script first defines a TranscriptionDataset class that inherits from the PyTorch Dataset class and loads the transcription data from a CSV file. The class implements the __len__ and __getitem__ methods to allow for iterating over the data.

Next, the script defines an LSTMModel class that inherits from the PyTorch nn.Module class and implements a single-layer LSTM network with a fully connected output layer. The forward method takes an input tensor x and returns a dictionary of output tensors corresponding to different parts of the input.

The train function is then defined, which takes a configuration dictionary as an argument. The function sets up logging, sets the device (GPU or CPU), loads the training and validation datasets, instantiates the LSTMModel, defines the optimizer and loss function, and sets up the training loop. The training loop iterates over the batches of the training dataset, calculates the loss, and updates the model weights via backpropagation. The loop also calculates the validation loss on the validation dataset at each epoch and logs the train and validation losses. The model weights are saved at each epoch, and the final model is saved at the end of training.

Finally, the script defines an argument parser that takes a configuration file as input and calls the train function with the configuration dictionary. Overall, the script loads the data, defines and trains the model, and saves the trained model and training logs for later use.
